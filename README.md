# Self-Driving-Car
Create a simulated self-driving car that learns to steer (and optionally throttle/brake) in a driving simulator using supervised learning (behavioral cloning) as a baseline. Then extend to perception modules (lane detection, object detection) and/or reinforcement learning (PPO) for improved robustness.
